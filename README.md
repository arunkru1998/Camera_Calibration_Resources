# Extrinsic Camera Calibration Resources

Welcome to the world of Extrinsic Camera Calibration! Whether you're diving into eye-in-hand or hand-in-eye calibration for the first time, this resource repository is tailored just for you. I've curated a collection of essentials to guide you through the process seamlessly.

## Why Extrinsic Camera Calibration?

Extrinsic Camera Calibration unlocks the magic of understanding the relationship between your camera and the real world. Whether you're pinpointing the end effector position in camera coordinates or vice versa, the process remains the same.

## Basics: Eye-in-Hand vs. Hand-in-Eye

No need to be confused! It is broken down for you:

- **Eye-in-Hand Calibration:** Transform from end effector to camera optical center.
- **Hand-in-Eye Calibration:** Find the end effector position in the camera frame.

Regardless of your choice, you'll need to perform intrinsic camera calibration. It's the input for the extrinsic calibration.
